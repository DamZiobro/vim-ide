2. About~

ProtoDef is designed to make the "manual" process of copying function 
prototypes from a C++ header file to a C++ implementation file automatic.
After you've defined the prototype in the header file, you can just hit a key
and all of the undefined prototypes will be defined for you at the current
cursor position.

==============================================================================
							*protodef-features*
3. Features~

ProtoDef has the following features:

  - Copies the prototypes to be as close to the header file declaration as
    possible
  - Will not make definitions for prototypes that are pure virtual or
    already have definitions in the header file
  - Always brings your implementation up to date with the header file
    by including all definitions that don't yet exist
  - Resilient to formatting changes.  If you change the format of your
    function definition or declaration, ProtoDef does not lose the
    relationship between them and will not bring in duplicate definitions
  - Removes default values that may be declared in the prototype that do
    not belong in the implementation

==============================================================================
							*protodef-usage*
4. Usage~

A mapping is made for you that is local to the buffer in the C++
implementation file called:
>
	nmap <buffer> <silent> <leader> ,PP
<
So all you have to do is simply hit {<leader>PP} on a line in the
implementation file and you will get the definitions put in at that spot.

Another mapping is included to generate prototypes without the namespace
definition as well:
>
	nmap <buffer> <silent> <leader> ,PN
<

==============================================================================
							*protodef-limitations*
5. Limitations~

C++ isn't a simple language to parse.  There are a ton of bits an pieces
that could be declared in extremely odd ways.  I wrote this to deal with the
C++ code that I write personally, and extended it to handle some of the stuff
that I noticed other people do.  It may not work 100% for you.

If you don't like the way things are formatted then you might consider passing
the results through a code formatter such as astyle
(http://astyle.sourceforge.net/).

==============================================================================
							*protodef-dependencies*
6. Dependencies~

ProtoDef has dependencies on the following:

  - Exuberant CTAGS 5.7 or better (http://ctags.sourceforge.net)
  - FSwitch plugin for Vim
    (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2590)
  - PERL (probably any current version would be fine).  You don't need to
    have Vim compiled with PERL support - we just need PERL to run a script
    that came with this plugin.

==============================================================================
							*protodef-setup*
7. Setup~

In order to get ProtoDef working you'll need to do the following:

  - Drop the {protodef.vim} file into the $VIM/plugin directory.
  - Drop the {protodef.txt} file into the $VIM/doc directory.
  - Run :helptags $VIM/doc
  - Put the pullproto.pl script somewhere.  The default expected location is
    inside the |$VIM| directory
  - Optionally tell ProtoDef where ctags and pullproto.pl are

==============================================================================
							*protodef-configure*
8. Configuration~

							*'protodefctagsexe'*
'protodefctagsexe'   string	(default is "ctags")
                     global

        This is the location and/or name of the ctags executable.  If ctags
	is in your PATH then the default will probably work just fine.  If
	it's not then you should put the full path to the executable in
	this variable.
>
             :let g:protodefctagsexe = '/mylocation/ctags/ctags.exe'
<

						       *'protodefprotogetter'*
'protodefprotogetter'   string	(default is $VIM . "/pullproto.pl")
                        global
	
	This is the location and/or name of the {pullproto.pl} script.  The
	default location is under the |$VIM| directory.

				                     *'protodefvaluedefaults'*
'protodefvaluedefaults' string	(default is big)
			global

	This variable is a dictionary that maps types to default values.
	You can customize this and if you wish to do so, you should probably
	just look in the code to see what you should make it look like.
	
				                  *'disable_protodef_sorting'*
'disable_protodef_sorting' whatever (default is not defined)
			   global

	Protodef will perform a sort on the functions placed in the
	implementation file.  If you don't want to do this then set this
	variable and the order of the functions will be the same as in the
	header file.

				                  *'disable_protodef_mapping'*
'disable_protodef_mapping' whatever (default is not defined)
			   global

	If you want to disable the creation of the the <leader>PP and
        <leader>PN mappings, just define this - it doesn't matter what you
	define it to be.

==============================================================================
   	*protodef-publicfunc* *ReturnSkeletonsFromPrototypesForCurrentBuffer()*

9. protodef#ReturnSkeletonsFromPrototypesForCurrentBuffer()~

This is the publicly accessible function that you can call if you want to take
the current buffer (a C++ implementation file) and pull the prototypes into
definitions within it.

This function takes a dictionary parameter to hold options.  The only option
that's supported at the moment is {includeNS}.  Here are some examples of
calling the function:
>
  " Get the prototypes and keep the namespaces, so that you'll get things
  " like 'ns1::ns2::ns3::Constructor()'
  let protos = protodef#ReturnSkeletonsFromPrototypesForCurrentBuffer({})

  " Get the prototypes without the namespaces, so that you'll get things
  " like 'Constructor()'
  let protos = protodef#ReturnSkeletonsFromPrototypesForCurrentBuffer({
                                 'includeNS' : 0})
<

							*protodef-changes*
A. Change History~

0.9.5
	- Fixed up a regular expression so it matches pointers and references
	  better (pointers and references attached to the name instead of the
	  type, which is hideous).  (Paolo Capriotti)
0.9.4
	- Made sure that we need at least 7.0 (Timon Kelter)
	- Introduced the disable_protodef_sorting variable.
	- Added a fix to deal with default parameters that were class
	  instances (e.g. MyClass()) (Matt Spear)
	- Fixed function prototype parsing in pullproto.pl such that regex
	  special characters are deal with nicely (Matt Spear)
	- Handle template specializations properly (Matt Spear)
	- Ensure that implementations in the header file but outside the class
	  definition are not brought in to the implementation (Dmitry Bashkatov)
0.9.3
	- Fixed bug in autocmd mapping to change the ",C" to ".C"
0.9.2
	- Added the option to eliminate the namespaces from the definitions
	- Added the <Leader>PN mapping to generate prototypes without
	  namespaces.
0.9.1
	- Fix for nested classes
0.9.0
	- Initial release

==============================================================================
							*protodef-bugs*
B. Known Bugs~

- If you change the variable name of a parameter in the implementation file
  (e.g. delete the variable name because you don't actually need it in the
  function - say it's a test stub function or something) then it looks to
  protodef like you haven't actually defined it yet in the implementation file
  and it will pull in a new one if you hit <leader>PP or <leader>PN
